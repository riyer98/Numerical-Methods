1) Explicit Method
	x range = [0,1]
	t range = [0,0.15]
	t steps = 30
	delt	= 0.005
	delx	= 0.1
	D	= 1
	Boundary condition: u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0 (Dirichlet)
	Initial condition: u(x,0) = 4*x*(1-x)

	Explicit Method is only stable if l = D*(delt)/(delx)^2 is less than 1/2.
	In the pdf, delt was taken to be 0.05, but then l = 0.05/(0.1)^2 = 5 > 1/2.
	Therefore, the result diverged and was unstable. Hence I have used delt = 0.005.


2) Implicit Method
	x range = [-5,5]
	t range = [0,10]
	t steps = 200
	delt	= 0.05
	delx	= 0.1
	D	= 1
	Boundary condition: du/dx |(-5,t) = du/dx |(5,t) = 0  (Neumann)
	Initial condition: u(x,0) = exp(-x^2)

	Implicit method is unconditionally stable so we can use delt and delx of our 
	choice. For the Neumann condition, i couldn't impose it exactly, so I did
	an approximate boundary condition that slope (delta u/delta x) = 0 or simply
	(delta u) at the boundaries = 0.
	


3) Crank-Nicolson Method
	x range = [0,1]
	t range = [0,0.75]
	t steps = 15
	delt	= 0.05
	delx	= 0.1
	D	= 1.44
	Boundary condition: 	u(0,t) = 2
				u(1,t) = 0.5 (Dirichlet)
	Initial condition: 	u(x,0) = 2 - 0.5*x + sin(pi*x)

	Crank-Nicolson method is unconditionally stable because it has incorporated
	the implicit component. It is also more accurate because the error in time in
	the other two methods is O(delt) but here it is O(delt^2).
