COMMENTS ON THE RESULTS


1)      The number of bound states will increase with increase in the depth as well
        as the width of the potential. Increasing the depth will allow bound states
        of higher energies whereas increasing the width will reduce the spacing 
        between the energy levels, hence allowing more states within the existing well.


2)      No matter how small the depth of the potential is, there will always be at 
        least 1 bound state, the ground state. It is of even parity and has no nodes 
        (i.e. it is not zero at any finite value of x).


3)	The consecutive states alternate in parity and the number of nodes increases by 
        1 for each level. The 1st excited state is of odd parity and has 1 node, the 
        2nd excited state is even parity with 2 nodes and so on


4)      The spacing between consecutive energy levels increases,that is, the levels are 
        further and further spaced. We can expect this because if the well is infinite,
        energy is proportional to n². Hence, if the ground state energy << well depth,
        The energy levels will approximately go as n².


5)	The number of bound states is proportional to the width a and the square root 
	of the depth V0. The exact expression is given by (mass= 1, hbar=1):
		n = ceil[2/π * √(2*V0) * a] 
	where ceil() is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number.
